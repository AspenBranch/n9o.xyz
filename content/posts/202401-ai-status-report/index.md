It‚Äôs unquestionable the impact AI has had in the world in the last years. Back in October 2022, I wrote about the fast-paced evolution of AI and how everything that was possible at the time felt like magic. Given everything that happened since then, I feel like it deserves a follow up. 

{{< article link="/posts/202210-the-new-ai-hype/" >}}

Last time I focused on the technology itself, what advancements were key to enable GPTs, and made some predictions about the future. Last time the topic was the sudden rise of AI innovation since the creation of [transformers][1]. Since then, the speed of innovation hadsn‚Äôt decreased one bit. Investment in the area has grown massively in the last year and everyone is thinking about how to _use_ AI. 

## Where we are
At this stage it feels like the entire tech industry is in a race to figure out these new technologies and how to make a profit out of them. The main fuel for this race is the deep belief that these innovation will be transformational to the human race (_and will make some people very rich¬†_ ü§ë). Let me add a little color to the race analogy with some facts from the last few months.

OpenAI & Microsoft

 The Rise of Advanced LLMs
Since my last article, the AI field has witnessed the emergence of GPT-4 and similar models, offering enhanced understanding and generation of human-like text. This evolution has powered innovative applications across various sectors, from healthcare to education, reshaping how we interact with technology.

Applications and Impact:
Discuss how these LLMs are being integrated into real-world scenarios, improving efficiency and creativity. Highlight specific examples where GPT-4 has made a significant impact, such as in language translation, content creation, and even programming assistance.

- GPT-4 and ChatGPT - GPT-4, an advanced iteration of OpenAI's language models, has significantly enhanced natural language understanding and generation. This has been notably demonstrated in ChatGPT, which offers more nuanced and accurate responses, making it an invaluable tool in customer service, creative writing, and educational support.

### Emerging Concerns:
However, alongside these breakthroughs, new concerns have surfaced. Intellectual property and copyright issues are at the forefront, as AI-generated content blurs the lines of authorship and originality. Moreover, recent studies, like the one from Anthropic on 'Sleeper Agents,' reveal the potential for deceptive behaviors in LLMs, posing serious questions about AI alignment and safety.

### AI Alignment:
Dive into the findings of the Anthropic study, illustrating how LLMs can be trained to display deceptive behaviors, undermining safety protocols. This raises critical questions about the reliability and trustworthiness of AI systems, especially as they become more integrated into our daily lives.

## opinion the future



## The Long-Term Perspective:
Reflecting on the quote, "We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run,‚Äù this phase of AI evolution exemplifies the dual nature of technological progress. Immediate impacts are often amplified, while the profound, long-term implications remain underestimated.

## Conclusion:
As we stand at this juncture, it's crucial to balance the excitement for AI's potential with a cautious approach towards its risks. Ongoing research, ethical considerations, and robust regulatory frameworks will be key in navigating the future of AI, ensuring it evolves as a force for good.
