As a Product Manager, more often than not, I notice people mixing up discussions about ideas and executions. Both when choosing new initiatives to bet on but also when evaluating what is happening in their industry. I think that knowing the difference between these two concepts is key for someone working on _building_ ideas, and can, ultimately, make a team succeed or fail.

## Final Thoughts

For a while now as someone who builds things



Ideas != Execution

What is an idea - an idea is a low fidelity version of an execution, an abstraction. 

When discussing these abstractions people “see” different things in their heads and therefore is hard to drive alignment

bubble idea
- how to create chart? handdrawn?

the two problems - 
- people tend to compare?
- hard to have alignment and manage expectations 

Spend too much time discussing ideas VS trying out execution

At least spend time discussing ideas knowing they are just ideas

Alignment and materialization
Execution materializes and idea and drives alignment

How to get alignment before building?

Examples
- Google Glass VS Apple Vision Pro
- Social Networks - Orkut, Hi5, etc - Facebook - and then Instagram
