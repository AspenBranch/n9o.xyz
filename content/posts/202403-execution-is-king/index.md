As a Product Manager, more often than not, I notice people mixing up ideas and _execution_ in discussions. Both when choosing evaluating new initiatives to bet on and when evaluating what is happening in their industry. Knowing the difference between these two concepts, how to manage them, and what importance they should have in different occasions is key for someone working on _building_ ideas (e.g. Product), and can, ultimately, make a company/team succeed or fail.

## Ideas VS Execution

## Examples

## Problems

## Bad Executions of Great Ideas

## Good Executions of Bad Ideas

## Why does it matter?

## Final Thoughts

For a while now as someone who builds things



Ideas != Execution

What is an idea - an idea is a low fidelity version of an execution, an abstraction. 

When discussing these abstractions people “see” different things in their heads and therefore is hard to drive alignment

bubble idea
- how to create chart? handdrawn?

the two problems - 
- people tend to compare?
- hard to have alignment and manage expectations 

Spend too much time discussing ideas VS trying out execution

At least spend time discussing ideas knowing they are just ideas

Alignment and materialization
Execution materializes and idea and drives alignment

How to get alignment before building?

Examples
- Google Glass VS Apple Vision Pro
- Social Networks - Orkut, Hi5, etc - Facebook - and then Instagram
