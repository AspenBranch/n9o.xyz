## Goals

### Completeness
Making sure that teams and groups own a domain end-to-end. In a complete domain, teams/groups should be able to build a clear value-based vision and roadmap. Domains need to be tight enough (no holes) and wide enough to be able to bring complete value over time as opposed to delivering features.

### Independence
Moving fast is one of the most important aspects for teams/groups’ success. Making sure that each team/group is independent over its domain will highly contribute to each team's ability to move fast and create value overall. Independence is achieved when a team has the ability to promote their mission and achieve their goals with the development team they are working with, and with minimum dependencies on other teams. Product dependencies are not limited to development teams and technical dependencies. Additional dependencies include the other PMs in the team, other delivery teams like data, UX, design, marketing, and also stakeholders like legal, compliance and finance.

### Clarity 
The domain should be clear for the internal team and external stakeholders. This will ensure that a) the team knows what their core function and goal is and b) that external stakeholders are aligned to the same vision. All the APIs for the team should aim to convey that clarity e.g. the name of the team.

### Balance
When creating or splitting domains for product groups, or within each group, it is important to ensure that there is a balanced distribution in terms of relevance and load of the topics. Otherwise teams can fall into scenarios where a single team is tackling all of the most important problems for the company with only a limited amount of the total available resources. Balance should also ensure that, to some extent, all groups and teams have a certain level of relevance and impact otherwise it could be hard to hire and motivate team members.



## Possible Paths

### Problem Definition - Goals, Metrics, Jobs-to-be-Done
In this method each team and group is responsible for a problem definition, which can be translated to a goal, metrics, and jobs-to-be-done. Teams can then touch whichever functionality they believe is going to solve that problem. The main benefit of this approach is pushing accountability to individual product managers, but it can result in multiple teams wanting (or needing) to work on the same product components at the same time and thus no one feeling ownership for those things. This is a good choice for companies with well-established product key performance indicators (KPIs) that capture customer and business outcomes

Completeness: high

Independence: medium to high 

Clarity: low to medium

Balance: high

Pros

The customer is always at the center of your product thinking
Easy to assign goals to teams and then measure product success
Easy to delegate decision making and accountability amongst product managers

Cons

Requires stable set of KPIs that won’t change often
Requires cross-team roadmap coordination as individual teams may need to touch a lot of product areas to hit goals
It takes time to get into customers’ heads (That’s why it’s important not to jump right into product design, but make sure everyone understands how each department views the customer)
 
 
### Functional - Products, Features, Tech Components
This structure splits groups and teams by functional modules like products, features, components, or layers (FE vs BE). This option is best suited for an early stage, where heavy lifting is required to deliver even the first releases. The vision and roadmap at this point are typically the overall product ones, and you mostly need the different parts to work well together towards the already defined scope. As organizations scale this becomes a bad option because as teams grow and their split gets more and more granular the level of dependencies between them increases dramatically and each team/group’s vision and roadmap are constrained leading to low customer centricity. 


Completeness: low to medium, as companies scale and the split gets more granular, completeness gets lower

Independence: medium

Clarity: high

Balance: medium

Pros

Very clear which team should handle specific feedback/bugs
Fewer dependencies than other options for smaller orgs
Easy to bring the right product person to external product meetings, such as a sales call

Cons

Causes confusion when features require infrastructure/architectural updates
Constraints vision/strategy/roadmap to module, feature, or product level (not very customer-centric)
Requires a lot of cross-team coordination when products are tightly integrated with each other, or have lower level dependencies (e.g. platform)



### Customer Journey
In this structure, each team/group is responsible for an overall customer journey, or a specific phase in that journey. For example, in a customer purchase flow, a product team can own user acquisition, another onboarding, another discovery, and another the checkout process. This method requires that each phase in the customer journey has enough substance to it. Often, there are important business metrics that closely mirror the success or failure of customers continuing their journey at those junctures, allowing for delegation of accountability. However, optimizing for specific metrics in parts of the overall flow might not help the overall metrics. This org structure requires a lot of design coordination to ensure a cohesive customer experience across the product(s). 

Completeness: medium to high (will be higher for mature products where each phase can have its own independent goals).

Independence: medium to high (will be higher for mature products where each phase can have its own independent goals)

Clarity: medium to high

Balance: medium

Pros

The approach allows efficient product scaling—the growth team drives customers to the product while other teams enhance product trial and engagement experiences.
Clear metrics you can assign to each product manager, such as conversion from free trial to paid or retention

Cons

If team members don’t understand their assigned customer stage, it could lead to inadequate product features, and thus a poor product experience.
Requires tight governance to ensure a consistent and great user experience across customer journey stages

### User Personas
Each team and group are assigned a persona and become responsible for that persona needs end-to-end. Usually used in products with multiple personas, where the needs of the various personas are independent and don’t conflict with each other (e.g. marketplace where there are buyers and sellers). This organization focuses teams on the needs of users, but it requires heavy coordination across teams and groups to avoid duplicating efforts, deviating from established design principles, or taking the product in different directions at the same time.

Completeness: high

Independence: medium to high, proportional to independence of needs for each persona

Clarity: high

Balance: low to high, depends on relevance of each persona for the business

Pros

Very customer-centric, encourages teams to think about customer needs/outcomes
Simplifies user research, each team can target interviews by the type of person they want to talk to and can become experts in that persona over time

Cons

Can pull the product in multiple directions at once
If personas have strong connections between them (e.g. two personas which are developers) it will lead to low independence across teams and groups
